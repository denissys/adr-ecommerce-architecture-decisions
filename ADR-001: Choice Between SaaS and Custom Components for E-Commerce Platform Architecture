# ADR-001: Choice Between SaaS and Custom Components for E-Commerce Platform Architecture

**Context:**
As we embark on the development and expansion of our E-Commerce platform, a critical architectural decision is whether to leverage existing SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions or build custom components in-house. This decision will have far-reaching implications for the platform's functionality, scalability, cost, and long-term maintenance.

**Decision:**
After careful consideration, we have decided to adopt a hybrid approach that combines SaaS solutions and custom components, taking into account the following criteria:

1. **Customization and Localization:** We recognize the need for customization to meet the specific requirements of different markets, including content localization, compliance with regional regulations, and adaptable user experiences. Custom components will be developed to address these market-specific needs.

2. **Security and Compliance:** Security and regulatory compliance are paramount. We will utilize reputable SaaS solutions that have robust security features and compliance certifications, especially in areas such as user authentication and data protection.

3. **Integration and CI/CD:** To ensure agility and efficient development processes, we will integrate our platform with widely used CI/CD tools and leverage SaaS solutions that provide seamless integration capabilities.

4. **Scalability and Performance:** The architecture will be designed to scale horizontally and vertically to handle increased traffic and user loads. Custom components will be optimized for performance, while SaaS solutions will be selected based on their ability to scale.

5. **Cost-Efficiency:** We will conduct a thorough cost-benefit analysis to determine where custom development provides a competitive advantage and where SaaS solutions offer cost-efficiency.

6. **Maintenance and Updates:** Regular maintenance and updates are essential. Custom components will have dedicated teams for maintenance, while SaaS solutions will be evaluated based on their reliability and update frequency.

**Reason:**
This hybrid approach allows us to harness the advantages of both SaaS and custom development. It provides the flexibility to address market-specific needs, maintain high levels of security and compliance, integrate effectively, and optimize costs while ensuring scalability and efficient maintenance.

**Consequences:**
- Customization and localization capabilities.
- Strong security and compliance measures.
- Effective integration with CI/CD processes.
- Scalability and performance optimization.
- Cost-effective architecture.
- Maintenance and updates as per best practices.
