# ADR-005: Content Localization

**Context:**
For the international expansion of the E-Commerce platform, it is essential to consider content localization specific to each market, including images, videos, product descriptions, and page layouts.

**Decision:**
We have decided to implement a content management system (CMS) that will enable efficient localization of all platform content to cater to the cultural and regional preferences of each market.

**Reason:**
This decision will enhance customer experience by adapting content to the culture and language of each market.

**Consequences:**
- Customized and localized content for each market.
- Improved customer experience.
